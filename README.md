This is my final submission for my Frontend Task-:

(1.) It has proper sign In/sign Up system which is connected to firebase.

(2.) Error tracking on wrong id/password

(3.) Minimum 6 character password required to increase security.

(4.) I have emphasized on UI, and  I haven't used any library except small library for modal, all components are pure css based.

(5.) Completely responsive website it is (Mobile/Ipad/Laptop).

(6.) Due to only 2 days of time and my regular job, I haven't optimized it much but in interview round I can tell how much optimize I can do it, I know it's not that optimized but keeping time constraint in mind I did it.

(7.) Logo is out of my creativity.

(8.) Good to have avatar feature added i.e different avatar based on gender.

(9.) Tried something with rating.
